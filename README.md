# breastCancerCoreQuestionnaire
This repository contains the Sociodemographic and Cultural Module of the Breast Cancer Core Questionnaire Project.

The Breast Cancer Core Questionnaire Project (BCCQP) was an initiative led by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in partnership with the US Public Health Service Office on Women's Health and the National Action Plan on Breast Cancer (NAPBC) in the mid-1990's. The goal was produce a set of harmonized questionnaire instruments to facilitate comparability across epidemiologic studies.

Drs. Nancy Krieger and Jarvis Chen developed the Sociodemographic and Cultural Module for the BCCQP in 1996. 

There are two versions:

Sociodemographic and Cultural Module - Core Version

Sociodemographic and Cultural Module - Full Version

As these questionnaires do not appear to be available online, we are making them available in this GitHub repository. Please cite:
