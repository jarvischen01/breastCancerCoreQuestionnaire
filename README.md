# Breast Cancer Core Questionnaire Project

The Breast Cancer Core Questionnaire (BCCQ) Project was a collaborative effort of NAPBC, the National Cancer
Institute (NCI), and Temple University√ïs Institute for Survey Research (ISR) to improve the epidemiologic study of breast
cancer risk factors. 

The six modules of the BCCQ and the leader of each respective module's design team were:

Krieger, Ph.D., and Jarvis T. Chen, ScD, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health
- *Occupational Exposures*, Ann Aschengrau, Sc.D., Boston University School of Public Health and Julia Brody, Ph.D., Silent Spring Institute
- *Environmental Exposures*, Steven Stellman, Ph.D., M.P.H., American Health Foundation
- *Personal Behaviors and Lifestyle*, Leslie Bernstein, Ph. D., University of Southern California
- *Diet and Nutrition*, Lenore Kohlmeier, Ph.D., University of North Carolina
